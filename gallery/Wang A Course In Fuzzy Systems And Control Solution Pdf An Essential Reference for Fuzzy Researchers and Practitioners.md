A Course In Fuzzy Systems and Control is a book by Li-Xin Wang that provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and applications of fuzzy logic and control systems. The book covers the basic concepts of fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, fuzzy relations, fuzzy inference, fuzzy control, and fuzzy systems, as well as some advanced topics such as adaptive fuzzy systems, fuzzy neural networks, fuzzy expert systems, and fuzzy modeling. The book also includes many examples and exercises to illustrate the concepts and techniques.

The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn about fuzzy systems and control, as well as for researchers and practitioners who want to apply fuzzy techniques to various fields such as engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, robotics, economics, management, and medicine. The book assumes some background knowledge in mathematics, linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, and classical control theory. However, the book also provides some review materials and appendices to help the readers with the necessary prerequisites.
 
The book is divided into 16 chapters. The first chapter introduces the motivation and history of fuzzy logic and control, as well as some basic definitions and notations. The second chapter presents the theory of fuzzy sets, including operations on fuzzy sets, properties of fuzzy sets, types of fuzzy sets, and extensions of fuzzy sets. The third chapter discusses the concept of fuzzy relations, including operations on fuzzy relations, properties of fuzzy relations, equivalence relations, compatibility relations, order relations, similarity relations, and composition of fuzzy relations. The fourth chapter introduces the notion of fuzzy logic, including propositional logic, predicate logic, modal logic, many-valued logic, linguistic variables, linguistic hedges, approximate reasoning, and defuzzification methods.
 
The fifth chapter explains the principle of fuzzy inference, including Mamdani inference method, Takagi-Sugeno inference method, Tsukamoto inference method, singleton fuzzifier method, Larsen product method, and generalized modus ponens. The sixth chapter describes the design of fuzzy controllers, including direct design method, indirect design method, fuzzy PID controller, fuzzy sliding mode controller, and hierarchical fuzzy controller. The seventh chapter analyzes the stability of fuzzy control systems, including Lyapunov stability theory, T-S model approach, parallel distributed compensation approach, and LMI approach. The eighth chapter introduces the concept of adaptive fuzzy systems, including adaptive fuzzy inference system, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, and adaptive T-S model-based controller.
 
The ninth chapter discusses the application of fuzzy systems to function approximation, including universal approximation theorem, fuzzy basis function networks, fuzzy clustering algorithms, and subtractive clustering algorithm. The tenth chapter presents the application of fuzzy systems to system identification, including parameter estimation methods, structure identification methods, and hybrid identification methods. The eleventh chapter explains the application of fuzzy systems to nonlinear control, including feedback linearization method, backstepping method, and passivity-based method. The twelfth chapter illustrates the application of fuzzy systems to optimal control, including dynamic programming method, Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation method, Pontryagin's maximum principle method, and calculus of variations method.
 
The thirteenth chapter describes the application of fuzzy systems to robust control, including H-infinity control method, mixed H2/H-infinity control method, and mu-synthesis method. The fourteenth chapter explores the application of fuzzy systems to intelligent control, including genetic algorithm-based method, particle swarm optimization-based method, ant colony optimization-based method, and reinforcement learning-based method. The fifteenth chapter demonstrates the application of fuzzy systems to various engineering problems, including inverted pendulum problem, robot arm problem, robot navigation problem, aircraft landing problem, and power system problem. The sixteenth chapter summarizes the main concepts and techniques of the book and provides some directions for future research.
 
The book is well-written and organized. It provides clear explanations and derivations of the theories and methods. It also provides many examples and exercises to help the readers understand and apply the concepts and techniques. The book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about or work with fuzzy systems and control.
